I've come from a background in mathematical analysis of complex graphs, to develop new analysis methods on the intersection of human genetics and single cell -omics. I did my PhD with Professor [Mauricio Barahona](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.barahona) in Imperial's mathematics department. My doctoral work involved graph-theoretical approaches to data-clustering; I showed that [multiscale community detection](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/6/2/157/4037125) based clustering achieves improved performance compared to popular clustering methods [without the need to set externally the number of clusters](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41109-019-0248-7) . I finished my PhD in 2019 and moved to the neurogenomics lab. My undergraduate degree was in Biomedical Engineering at Tsinghua University followed by an MSc in Biomedical Computing at Munich. I got involved in biology initially while studying the [network structure of single cell RNA-seq data](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/70845) during my PhD.
