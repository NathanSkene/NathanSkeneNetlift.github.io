I'm a second year PhD in the Skene lab funded by the [Beijing Genomics Institute](http://www.bgi.com). My undergraduate background was in psychology, during which I developed a great interest in human genetics and genomics through my neurobiology course and wider reading. My work on psychiatric genetics begun at Imperial in the lab of [Jackie de Belleroche](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/193071/obituary-professor-jackie-belleroche-phd-ds/). I am now very happy in Nathan's lab pursuing my true interests, unravelling the secrets hidden in the sumstats and learning to be a bioinformatician!
